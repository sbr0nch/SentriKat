## THE OPPORTUNITY

### The Problem

Organizations face a critical cybersecurity challenge:
- **40,009 CVEs** published in 2024 alone, 38% increase YoY ([CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/over-40000-cves-published-in-2024/))
- **1,484 actively exploited vulnerabilities** tracked by CISA KEV ([SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-kev-catalog-expanded-20-in-2025-topping-1480-entries/))
- **CISA mandates** remediation of exploited vulnerabilities within 14-30 days ([CISA BOD 22-01](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities))
- **Most companies** don't know what software they have installed
- **Manual tracking** is error-prone and time-consuming
- **Non-compliance** leads to breaches, fines, and reputation damage

3. **Alerts** security teams via email, Slack, Teams, Jira
4. **Tracks** remediation with due dates and acknowledgements
5. **Reports** compliance status for audits (CISA BOD 22-01, NIS2)
