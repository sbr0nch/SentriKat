# Investigation: CVE-2026-2441 Not Appearing in SentriKat

**Date:** 2026-02-16
**CVE:** CVE-2026-2441 (Chrome 0-day)
**Status:** NOT VISIBLE in SentriKat — root cause identified

---

## Scenario

A Chrome 0-day (CVE-2026-2441) was dropped. We expected it to appear in SentriKat after running sync and admintools-remap. It did not appear.

## What We Did

1. Started the SentriKat server
2. Ran a **sync** (triggers CISA KEV download + NVD recent CVEs + EUVD enrichment)
3. Ran **admintools-remap** (re-applies CPE mappings to products, then rematches all products against known CVEs)
4. CVE-2026-2441 still does not appear in the dashboard

## Root Cause

**SentriKat has no knowledge of CVE-2026-2441 because none of its 3 data sources have published it yet.**

SentriKat pulls vulnerability data from exactly 3 external feeds:

| Source | Frequency | Status for CVE-2026-2441 |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **CISA KEV** (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) | Daily | **NOT PUBLISHED YET** — confirmed by user |
| **NVD API 2.0** (HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs, last 6h window) | Every 2 hours | **NOT PUBLISHED YET** — likely pending NVD analysis |
| **ENISA EUVD** (European exploited vulns) | Every 6 hours | **NOT PUBLISHED YET** — likely pending ENISA processing |

Running sync and remap repeatedly does not help — those commands re-download feeds that do not contain this CVE. The CVE literally does not exist in any upstream database that SentriKat reads from.

**There is no manual CVE creation endpoint in SentriKat.** All vulnerabilities enter the system exclusively through automated sync from the 3 sources above.

## How the Pipeline Works (for context)

```
External Feeds (CISA KEV / NVD / EUVD)
    │
    ▼
[SYNC] Downloads CVE data → stores in Vulnerability table
    │
    ▼
[CPE FETCH] Gets version ranges from NVD for each CVE
    │
    ▼
[REMAP] Assigns CPE identifiers to products (google:chrome, etc.)
    │
    ▼
[REMATCH] Compares every CVE against every product:
    ├─ CPE vendor:product match?
    ├─ Product version in affected range?
    ├─ Vendor fix override (Path B) suppressing it?
    └─ If all checks pass → VulnerabilityMatch created → appears on dashboard
```

**The pipeline is working correctly.** The problem is at step 1 — no data to ingest.

## Why Sync + Remap Didn't Help

- **Sync** re-downloads CISA KEV, queries NVD for recent CVEs, and checks EUVD. If CVE-2026-2441 isn't in any of those feeds, sync finds nothing new.
- **Remap** re-assigns CPE identifiers (e.g., `google:chrome`) to products and rematches against known CVEs. But if the CVE doesn't exist in the Vulnerability table, there's nothing to match against.

Both commands are working as designed — the input data simply doesn't include this CVE yet.

## What Needs to Happen for CVE-2026-2441 to Appear

One of these must occur:

1. **CISA adds it to the KEV catalog** → next daily sync picks it up automatically
2. **NVD publishes it with HIGH or CRITICAL severity** → next 2-hour NVD sync picks it up
3. **ENISA adds it to the EUVD exploited list** → next 6-hour EUVD sync picks it up

Once ANY source publishes it, SentriKat will:
- Import the CVE record
- Fetch CPE version ranges from NVD
- Auto-match it to Chrome products (CPE mapping `google:chrome` already exists, confidence 0.95)
- Display it on the dashboard

## Recommendations to Investigate Further

### Check if NVD has the CVE yet
```
curl -s "https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?cveId=CVE-2026-2441" | python3 -m json.tool
```
- If `totalResults: 0` → NVD doesn't have it yet
- If it returns data → check `vulnStatus` (should not be "Rejected"/"Disputed") and `metrics` for severity

### Check if CISA KEV has it
```
curl -s "https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
matches = [v for v in data['vulnerabilities'] if v['cveID'] == 'CVE-2026-2441']
print(json.dumps(matches, indent=2) if matches else 'NOT IN CISA KEV')
"
```

### Check if EUVD has it
```
curl -s "https://euvdservices.enisa.europa.eu/api/exploitedvulnerabilities" | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
matches = [v for v in data.get('items', data) if 'CVE-2026-2441' in str(v)]
print(json.dumps(matches, indent=2) if matches else 'NOT IN EUVD')
"
```

### Check SentriKat's last sync status
Look at the SyncLog table or the health endpoint to confirm syncs are completing successfully.

### Check if Chrome products have correct CPE mapping
In the admin panel, verify Chrome products show `cpe_vendor=google`, `cpe_product=chrome`. If CPE is missing, the match won't happen even after the CVE is imported.

## Possible Enhancement: Manual CVE Ingestion

SentriKat currently has **no way to manually add a CVE**. For 0-day scenarios where the CVE is known but not yet in any feed, consider:

1. **Adding a manual CVE creation endpoint** (admin-only) to bridge the gap between public disclosure and feed publication
2. **Adding a GitHub Advisory Database source** as a 4th feed (often faster than CISA KEV)
3. **Adding a direct NVD CVE ID lookup** — allow admins to enter a CVE ID and query NVD on-demand

## Unrelated: Portal 520 Error

The update checker hitting `license.sentrikat.com/api/v1/releases/latest` returns a 520 error. This is a current known issue — the portal endpoint hasn't been built yet. Non-blocking, the app works fine without it.
